# NuvaPlayerSynchro - ULTRA HIGH PERFORMANCE Configuration
# ==================================================
#
# This plugin is now optimized for EXTREME performance and can handle
# thousands of concurrent players with MongoDB and ultra-aggressive settings.
#
# PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATIONS ACTIVE:
# - MongoDB with 20-100 connection pool
# - Asynchronous batch processing (25 operations/batch)
# - Ultra-aggressive thread pools (CPU cores * 4)
# - Advanced caching with LRU eviction (2000 entries)
# - Compression enabled (zstd/snappy/zlib)
# - Unordered bulk writes for maximum speed
#
# PERFORMANCE PRESETS:
#
# === SMALL SERVER (1-50 players) ===
# autosave.interval: 600 (10 minutes)
# autosave.high-load-threshold: 50
# database.mongodb.connection-pool.max-size: 30
#
# === MEDIUM SERVER (50-200 players) ===
# autosave.interval: 300 (5 minutes) - DEFAULT
# autosave.high-load-threshold: 100
# database.mongodb.connection-pool.max-size: 50
#
# === LARGE SERVER (200-500 players) ===
# autosave.interval: 180 (3 minutes)
# autosave.high-load-interval: 45 (45 seconds)
# autosave.high-load-threshold: 200
# database.mongodb.connection-pool.max-size: 75
#
# === MASSIVE SERVER (500+ players) ===
