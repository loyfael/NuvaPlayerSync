**Ultra-high-performance player data synchronization plugin for Minecraft servers powered by MongoDB**

NuvaPlayerSynchro is designed to handle **thousands of concurrent players** with MongoDB's NoSQL performance, optimized threading, advanced caching, and comprehensive crash protection. Perfect for massive Minecraft networks requiring blazing-fast player data synchronization.

> [!WARNING]
> NuvaPlayerSynchro is designed for high-concurrency environments and is theoretically suitable for large Minecraft networks.
> However, this plugin is **not yet ready for production use** and should preferably be used on **test or development servers**.
> If you choose to use it in a production environment, it is entirely **at your own risk**.
> It is **strongly recommended** to install an additional inventory backup plugin to ensure player inventory recovery in case of data loss or unexpected issues.
> If you experience any problems, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 mongo:6.0
```

### 2. Install Plugin

1. **Download** the latest release from [Releases](https://github.com/loyfael/NuvaPlayerSynchro/releases)
2. **Place** the `.jar` file in your server's `plugins/` folder
3. **Configure** your MongoDB settings in `config.yml`
4. **Restart** your server
5. **Enjoy** ultra-high-performance player data synchronization!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic MongoDB Setup

```yaml
database:
  type: "mongodb"
  mongodb:
    host: "localhost"
    port: 27017
    database: "minecraft"
    username: ""  # Leave empty for no auth
    password: ""  # Leave empty for no auth
```

### Performance Presets

#### Small Server (1-50 players)
```yaml
autosave:
  interval: 600  # 10 minutes
  high-load-threshold: 50
database:
  mongodb:
    connection-pool:
      max-size: 30
```

#### Medium Server (50-200 players) - **DEFAULT**
```yaml
autosave:
  interval: 300  # 5 minutes
  high-load-threshold: 100
database:
  mongodb:
    connection-pool:
      max-size: 50
```

#### Large Server (200-500 players)
```yaml
autosave:
  interval: 180  # 3 minutes
  high-load-interval: 45
  high-load-threshold: 200
database:
  mongodb:
    connection-pool:
      max-size: 75
```

#### Massive Server (500+ players)
```yaml
autosave:
  interval: 120  # 2 minutes
  high-load-interval: 30
  high-load-threshold: 300
database:
  mongodb:
    connection-pool:
      max-size: 100
```

## üéØ Performance Optimizations

### Why MongoDB over MySQL/MariaDB/PostgreSQL?

MongoDB was specifically chosen for this plugin because player data in Minecraft is naturally hierarchical and document-based (inventories, enderchests, complex nested structures). Unlike MySQL which requires complex table relationships and JOIN operations that become bottlenecks under high concurrency, MongoDB stores player data as single documents, enabling atomic operations and eliminating the need for expensive relational queries. The NoSQL architecture provides superior horizontal scalability, native JSON handling for inventory serialization, and built-in sharding capabilities that make it ideal for massive Minecraft networks with thousands of concurrent players. Additionally, MongoDB's connection pooling and bulk write operations offer significantly better performance for the frequent read/write patterns typical in player data synchronization.

### MongoDB Server Configuration
Add to your `mongod.conf`:

```yaml
storage:
  wiredTiger:
    engineConfig:
      cacheSizeGB: 2
    collectionConfig:
      blockCompressor: zstd
net:
  maxIncomingConnections: 200
operationProfiling:
  mode: off
```
